# Memory App

#### created in June 2019

This Memory works like the known game. There are shuffled cards laying face down on the table. The task is to collect as much matching pairs of cards as possible. 


<p> &nbsp </p>

## how it works

There are different settings where the user can choose out of:
<p> &nbsp </p>

* Difficulty:
   * easy (6 very different cards)
   * intermediate (12 cards, some similar, some different)
   * difficult (16 quite similar cards)
   <p> &nbsp </p>
   
* Topics:
   * fruits
   * animals
   * transport
   <p> &nbsp </p>
   
* Playermode:
   * singleplayer (you play against a timer, the time itself depends on the difficulty)
   * multiplayer (you take turns playing against anonther player, when you are right you can try again)
   
   <p> &nbsp </p>
   
Additionally there is a highscore for singleplayer, which is safed in a SharedPreference, you get 3 points for a match, otherwise you get -1 point. The highest three scores are saved
